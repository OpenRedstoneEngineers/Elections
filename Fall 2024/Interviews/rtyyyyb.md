## Why do you want to be a moderator for our community, and what motivates you to help manage it?
because i have bee a part for a decent amount of time i have become fond of the community and the invinting and helpfull nature but also because what keept me going in ore was the competitions always giving me something new to challange myself with 

## What experience do you have with moderation or community management, either online or offline?
i have mainly moderated for some streamers but i do manage the roles for VCB discord

## How would you handle a situation where two members are in a heated argument that violates community guidelines?
i would attept to disccorage the argument and switch to another topic but if they persist i would distubute the neccicary punnishment to both offending members 

## Suppose you had to enforce a rule or policy that was unpopular. How would you handle it?
i would tell the offending members that it doesnt matter if they like the rule or not and that either way it should still be followed and remind them it would have been decided by the staff team and no a single person with malicious intent to intionaly degrade there experience

## How do you balance enforcing rules with maintaining a positive, welcoming atmosphere?
i would try to keep my tone frieindly and welcoming so that if any user who mistakenly or not broke a role wouldnt feel threataned but instead helpfully reminded 

## What qualities do you think are most important in a moderator, and how do you embody them?
being equal to all members as if you are one of them to get on there level as to see there point of view.
and i embosy them by trying to know alot of the members and there v i b e 

## If a member frequently toes the line without technically breaking any rules, how would you approach them?
i would remind them that what they are doing go potentialy cause them to be punished and there kind of behavior will not be well respected 

## How would you prioritize tasks if you encountered multiple moderation issues at once?
i would prioritise the larger offenses over more minor offenses and ask another staff member for assistance but if none is there i would still keep an eye over the smaller offense untill the larger one is resolved such as prioritising stopping a user from making a lag machine over someone nbt banning someother user

## What improvements would you like to see in our community, and how would you help achieve them as a moderator?
i would like to see more competitons and engagement bettwen the members and members of staff and if i were a moderator i would be able to facilitate those competitons and i would think that being a moderator would not degrade my activity on the ore discord  and the mc server but most likely heighten it 

## How would you handle a situation where another moderator acted in a way you disagreed with?
if they had already applied a punishment that i dissagred with i would brink it up privately in a staff channel that i dissagred with them and get the opinion of other staff members to see if they agree or dissagree with the punishment or not.
