## Why do you want to be a moderator for our community, and what motivates you to help manage it?
I've enjoyed playing on this server for almost 3 years and made many friends in the community, and I'd absolutely love to be able to give something back, keeping it the same safe and friendly space I've spent so much time in.

## What experience do you have with moderation or community management, either online or offline?
Yup! I have hosted and moderated multiple MC servers over the past 4-5 years (some public, some private) as well as discord communities.

## How would you handle a situation where two members are in a heated argument that violates community guidelines?
Notify them that the conversation is against guidelines and that they need to leave that topic behind.
Should the argument continue, give a final warning about their behaviour, and if it continues, a temporary ban or another suitable punishment may be given

## Suppose you had to enforce a rule or policy that was unpopular. How would you handle it?
Unfortunately for some, rules are rules.
If people were not following a rule they don't agree with they will be reminded that it is a rule and they have to follow it.
If a lot of people complain about the rule, then there should be some assessment of why people don't like the rule, and whether it stays as it is, or if it can be tweaked.

## How do you balance enforcing rules with maintaining a positive, welcoming atmosphere?
I've always enjoyed that the current staff are regularly on the server and interact with the community.
Continuing to do this makes people feel more welcome, and therefore more receptive to being told when they are breaking guidelines helping to keep a safe environment for everyone.

## What qualities do you think are most important in a moderator, and how do you embody them?
Being able to positively engage with the community is extremely important, but also being able to enforce rules when necessary is equally important.
Due to my past experience moderating, I am usually quite good at spotting when an issue may occur, and how to de-escalate a situation before it gets out of hand.


## If a member frequently toes the line without technically breaking any rules, how would you approach them?
I would calmly inform them of the rules they're almost breaking, reminding them that its meant to be a positive environment and that continuing to do so would lead to a potential rule breaking issue that could lead to punishment.


## How would you prioritize tasks if you encountered multiple moderation issues at once?
Depending on the nature of the different incidents, I would either start working on them from the most important to the least, or contact other staff members to assist in solving the different issues.

## What improvements would you like to see in our community, and how would you help achieve them as a moderator?
More frequent community events to bring the server together.
I'd like to organise more town hall events, teaching sessions from knowledgeable server members, and more competitions of different skill levels.

## How would you handle a situation where another moderator acted in a way you disagreed with?
Likely privately message that moderator politely asking why they did what they did to try reach understanding, and if I still disagree, let them know why and what I would have personally done.
