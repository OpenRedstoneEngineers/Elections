## Why do you want to be a moderator for our community, and what motivates you to help manage it?
I really enjoy seeing people come together and teach each other and do cool stuff.
I think ORE is an amazing place and I want to help contribute to that and support the community.
I want it to be an environment where everyone can feel safe and respected, no matter their background or their knowledge level.

## What experience do you have with moderation or community management, either online or offline?
I have done technical stuff for a few smaller social servers, both Minecraft side, as well as Discord side.
I have also done some moderation for those and argument resolution.
Additionally I've been a project manager for a t-shirt cannon robot, a lead of lighting systems, a FTC team captain, a coach for FLL teams, and an assistant manager for two FTC teams.
Even though not all is similar to moderation, all of it has given me experience with conflict resolution, community management, and such.

## How would you handle a situation where two members are in a heated argument that violates community guidelines?
I would start by trying to get the members to cool down and diffuse the immediate situation.
If that doesn't work I would most likely assign very short timeouts.
In either case I would then immediately talk to both members to get both sides of the story to make a final decision on punishment.
Depending on the situation I might also ask another staff member for input so that I can avoid any personal bias and be as fair as possible.
Given I'm unsure what the current internal policy is, so if that does differ from my previously stated actions I would also follow that.

## Suppose you had to enforce a rule or policy that was unpopular. How would you handle it?
I think this is a very open question since I feel it would depend on the rule or policy.
I care a lot about what the community wants, however I also understand the need for unpopular decisions at times.
Assuming there is no option to meet in the middle, I would uphold the rule or policy.

## How do you balance enforcing rules with maintaining a positive, welcoming atmosphere?
I would make sure that anyone who strays too close to the line of breaking the rules is aptly warned.
Additionally I would make sure to use language that isn't condescending or criticizing as to not heat things up more.
I would do my best to gently remind people and do my best to act as an equal.

## What qualities do you think are most important in a moderator, and how do you embody them?
I think the ability to fully understand situations and remember that incidents are very flexible things in the sense that no two are alike and therefore its tough to fit them into molds that will work 100% of the time and also to stay cool, collected, and unbiased.
I believe I embody these because I like to take the time to gather all aspects and sides of a situation and working with the members to resolve the issues.
I also am very good under pressure/stress and wouldn't hesitate to ask another staff to take over if I'm too close to an issue.

## If a member frequently toes the line without technically breaking any rules, how would you approach them?
I would gently remind them of the rules, likely privately as to not spark arguments or embarrassment (which could lead to a worse situation).
Depending on the nature of the rules being toed, I may enforce some light punishment after a few warnings to make it clear that rules are rules, however this wouldn't be more than an hour or two of timeout/temp ban.

## How would you prioritize tasks if you encountered multiple moderation issues at once?
I would deal with the issue that most disturbs the peace and safety of the community or the one that is most pressing.
If two issues come up that are on equal levels I would most likely choose the one that came up earlier or the one that I can mitigate quicker.
I also might see if there are other staff available to help with the incidents.


## What improvements would you like to see in our community, and how would you help achieve them as a moderator?
I would like to see increased transparency.
There have been incidents in the past where I have been on the receiving end of a moderation action that was due to some "unwritten rule" or a rule that is not shown to members.
To help with this, I would help push for and help write deeper rules documentation.
I would also like to see less moderation that doesn't look at the entire situation.
I'm aware that it's quite rare, however I have seen in the past incidents in which a punishment was decided before the moderator fully understood the incident.
To help achieve this, I would make sure to get the full story from all parties before I made any final decisions.
(I'd also like to see capo banned, so I'd probably ban capo)

## How would you handle a situation where another moderator acted in a way you disagreed with?
If its an action as a moderator, I would approach that moderator individually to see if I could further understand their perspective on an issue in a non-aggressive/non-argumentative way.
If I still disagreed with it I would bring it up with an admin.
If it was an action as a member, I would just immediately bring it up with an admin.
I don't want to be someone who is always disagreeing with other staff however I also don't want members to be unfairly treated.
