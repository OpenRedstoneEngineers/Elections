## Why do you want to be a moderator for our community, and what motivates you to help manage it?
i want to be a moderator for our community because ive been part of this community for a while now and id like to be able to give back to it.
for motivation, on top of what I've already mentioned, once I set myself into project or position I tend to commit to it quite heavily

## What experience do you have with moderation or community management, either online or offline?
i am a staff member on mattbatwing's minecraft server, and have been working on managing the mattbatwings+recess community also, aside from things that are closely related to this community, ive been managing multiple large student stem projects lately

## How would you handle a situation where two members are in a heated argument that violates community guidelines?
depending on the severity of the situation, i would almost always initially start with verbal de-escalation, as from my experience that tends to work 99% of the time, especially with the weight of a staff role, if this proves unsuccessful, I would move towards talking about or referring to rules/policies and advise against continuing, if this further proves unsuccessful i would proceed to issue sanctions in accordance with moderation guidelines, though i do not believe getting to that stage is nessesary with almost any argument

## Suppose you had to enforce a rule or policy that was unpopular. How would you handle it?
in my opinion, the overall purpose of staff members in a community is to facilitate the safety and happiness of all its members within the community as much as possible, as a result, depending on the exact situation, I would likely attempt to convey my own reasoning/overall staff reasoning no why the rule/policy is important/necessary, if this doesnt work or does not apply to this situation, then I would deal with the situation on a purely case by case basis

## How do you balance enforcing rules with maintaining a positive, welcoming atmosphere?
verbal reasoning and verbal de-escalation are the main ways i tend to deal with this, as directly enforcing rules when unnecessary can often create a divide between the member's of its community and its staff, leading to the lack of a positive, welcoming atmosphere (from my personal experience)

## What qualities do you think are most important in a moderator, and how do you embody them?
integration in the community, being an accepted and appreciated part of a community is, in my opinion, vital to being a moderator of a community as moderators are there to support the community to allow it to function, i would like to think that being part of this community for several years i satisfy this.

the ability to verbally de-escalate an argument, something i see novice or inexperienced moderators do across multiple communities, is to not attempt verbal de-escalation and move directly to sanctions even for the tiniest of things, as ive said before, i personally highly disagree with this approach in most scenarios, especially considering that a very high percentage of the community are children.
once again, i would like to think that through my own personal experiences i have been able to refine this skill specifically for these kinds of applications, not to say that im anywhere near the best at this, though

## If a member frequently toes the line without technically breaking any rules, how would you approach them?
depends in what context, if a member is upsetting/causing an inconvenience to other members of the community then i would treat the scenario similar to if a light rule was broken, if the person doing this is simply doing it for attention then i tend to find ignoring them the best strategy as they tend to stop

## How would you prioritize tasks if you encountered multiple moderation issues at once?
here is a rough tier list i believe i follow (take this with a grain of salt, as like most other people i will look at the situation on a case by case basis)

member wellbeing/safety, e.g.
cases where someone is being harrased, someone is distraught about loosing their build by accident, etc

data loss, e.g.
missing/destroyed builds, etc

impact on wider community, e.g.
arguments taking place in game chat flooding chat  (with this particular example i may prioritise it over some other cases if it impedes on my ability to deal with the other situation)

limiting ability to use community resources, e.g.
unable to interact with a server, chat, forum, etc 

i think about cases in terms of more much more critical is one case over another in terms of these criteria, with the top ones being more relavent, once again this is only a rough idea that i came up with on the spot to demonstrate how i think about things, in reality its likely much more subjective though

## What improvements would you like to see in our community, and how would you help achieve them as a moderator?
i believe that a lot of aspects of this community deserve a more formal structure than they currently have, things like teaching, showcasing, cataloging, etc deserve infrastructure that takes time and effort to design and implement in a successful way.
i would like to believe that as a moderator i would attempt trying to design some of these structures in a more active way by getting continuous community feedback on concepts and iteratively designing these structures over a long period of time in order to create something that is as close to perfect as something can get for the community, and as a result will be used and will last.

thinking externally, I would also like to help facilitate connections and partnerships with other similar communities and organizations where wanted, in order to create a pseudo-academic network, almost all of the work related to ore has been internal, or at least not extending beyond the computational redstone community, with ore being a center of the computational community, i would like to change that, if there is a will to do so from the community when presented with the option.


## How would you handle a situation where another moderator acted in a way you disagreed with?
if its minor i would obviously ignore it, if I believed that the action of a moderator was incorrect with the information of the situation i have i would message them to inquire about their logic behind that decision, potentially starting a constructive conversation and providing my opinion/advice if wanted
