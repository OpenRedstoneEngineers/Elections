## Why do you want to be a moderator for our community, and what motivates you to help manage it?
I've been in this community for countless hours (actually you could count them, it's approx.
over 5000 hours).
It certainly shaped who I am now.
I would love to contribute to it because I truly enjoy being here.

## What experience do you have with moderation or community management, either online or offline?
Nothing particularly notable.

## How would you handle a situation where two members are in a heated argument that violates community guidelines?
Initiate protocol ClockWorK.
Calm, Warn, Kick.
To elaborate, try toning down the conversation before it gets exceedingly heated, if the argument escalates issue a warning, if that doesn't help - punish accordingly.


## Suppose you had to enforce a rule or policy that was unpopular. How would you handle it?
Formulate decisive opinion, create a great slogan, hack the voter's brain.
Do not use censorship tho, desipte being effective we do not want 1984 here, right?

## How do you balance enforcing rules with maintaining a positive, welcoming atmosphere?
The issued punishements should be clear.
Everyone must know why someone was punished, both the guilty and interested innocents.
If someone is breaking the "positive, welcoming atmosphere", they need to be dealt with.

## What qualities do you think are most important in a moderator, and how do you embody them?
Be understanding, try to learn why someone is behaving the way they are behaving.
Be clear about why you as a moderator act in a specific way.
I have omnipotent knowledge so I understand EVERYTHING, ableit admittedly my actions may seem chaotic.

## If a member frequently toes the line without technically breaking any rules, how would you approach them?
High five, I love doing this myself.
In theory, not breaking the rules should mean it doesn't negatively impact the community.
I understand that the rules are only a guidelines, but if not breaking them does negatively impact the server it may be the case they need updating.
And what to do with such a person? Can try talking to them, if that doesn't work can try ignoring them so they get bored.


## How would you prioritize tasks if you encountered multiple moderation issues at once?
Sort the tasks by their priority index.
To calculate such index:
	multiply base priority factor times the time passed divided by the time priority factor.
Specific values for the priority factors are still being calculated by my neural network, so I cannot include them here yet.

## What improvements would you like to see in our community, and how would you help achieve them as a moderator?
I think the best improvement of this community would be me being a mod.
I can help achieve that by being a mod.

## How would you handle a situation where another moderator acted in a way you disagreed with?
Talk to them why they acted in this way, try to understand them.
Then it depends on the situation.
Hopefully there won't be any intolerable cases, only some small misunderstandings.
As I said, it highly depends on the situation.
