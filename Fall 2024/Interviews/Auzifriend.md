## Why do you want to be a moderator for our community, and what motivates you to help manage it?
I'd like to improve areas of the server to be more welcoming to new people, such as improving spawn/ hub, my motivation is being able to do as such.

## What experience do you have with moderation or community management, either online or offline?
Apart from sorting disagreements on a personal SMP, none.

## How would you handle a situation where two members are in a heated argument that violates community guidelines?
I would get both sides of the story, ask witnesses, and talk to other staff (if available) to see what happens next.
if no other staff can help - I will refer to the rules to see who is in the wrong more-so.

## Suppose you had to enforce a rule or policy that was unpopular. How would you handle it?
Attempt to ease members into the policy, giving chances when broken, and trying placate/ appease the members into believing the rule is correct.

## How do you balance enforcing rules with maintaining a positive, welcoming atmosphere?
Don't act above other people; give 2nd and 3rd chances to people; allow people to explain why they did wrong.

## What qualities do you think are most important in a moderator, and how do you embody them?
To do the right thing, and to not act above others - such as being power hungry.

## If a member frequently toes the line without technically breaking any rules, how would you approach them?
Tell them to stop, if they do not - they will kicked/ temp banned

## How would you prioritize tasks if you encountered multiple moderation issues at once?
Attempt to share issues with other staff; go at the issues one at a time; try to evaluate which is the most important issue which will be sorted first.

## What improvements would you like to see in our community, and how would you help achieve them as a moderator?
Improvements in certain physical areas such as hub, spawn areas, PoL.
As well as trying to bring new seasonals to interest new/ old players.

## How would you handle a situation where another moderator acted in a way you disagreed with?
